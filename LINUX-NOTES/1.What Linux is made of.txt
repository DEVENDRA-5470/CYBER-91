1.What Linux is made of ?
Linux is not just an operating system its a layered architecture like a stack.

top -> bottom
1.User application. (ls,cat,python,ngnix,docker)
2.Shell
3.System libraries (glibc)
4.System calls
5.kernal
6.Hardware.

1.User Application :
 	program that you run :
 		ls cat vim touch
 		docker container
 		ngnix
2.Shell:
 command interpreter
 	bash (.sh)
 	zsh
 	fish
 Role : take your command,analyze , Expand variables , pass request to kernel via system calls.

3.System libraries (glibc) :
Program do not directly talk to the kernel they use libraries.
glibc -> make system call (low-level api) -> kernel does actual job.

4.System Calls:
These are the API of kernel.

Example :
 	open() -> Open a file or directories  and return a file handler.
 	read() : Reads bytes from a file descriptor into memory.
 	fork() Create new child process by duplicating the current process.
 	exec() / execve() -> Replace the current process with new program
Everything you do hits syscall behind the scene.

5.Kernel :
The core control everything (the boss):
 	CPU scheduling
 	Memory management
 	Networking
 	File system
 	Device Drivers
 	Security(permissions isolation.)

6.Hardware.
 	CPU
 	RAM
 	MOUSE
 	HARD-DISK
 	KEYBORAD

1.Kernal Space and User space.
**1.Kernel Space:**

	inside the kernel

 	 who runs here ?
kernel code
 		Device Driver
 		Core OS process
 	Privileges:
 		full access hardware , memory ,CPU.
 	if kernel crash -> whole system dies.

**1.User Space:**

 	Outside the kernel where normal apps run.

 	 who runs here ?
bash
 		python
 		chrome
 		docker
 		server
 		programs

 	 Privileges:
 		limited : Cannot touch hardware directly.

System call (Syscall): A gateway (controlled door) though which user programs talk to the Linux kernel.

glibc : it is a big helper library that gives programs basic function like open file,read,write,print,create process use memory.

EASY ANALOGY:
kernel : Government (Control everything)

 	Application : Citizen(must follow rules)
 	Hardware : Road, Power, building
 	System call : legal requests citizen submit to government.
